# Dependency-Graph-based-Build-System

## Overview

This project implements an optimized build system using a directed graph structure. Nodes in the graph represent individual build tasks, while edges denote task dependencies.

## Features

- **Selective Compilation:** The system intelligently compiles only the changed files, minimizing unnecessary compilation steps.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Tasks and dependencies are dynamically visualized to provide insights into the project's build workflow.
- **Efficient Dependency Management:** Dependencies are efficiently managed, allowing developers to understand and optimize the build pipeline.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimized-build-system.git
